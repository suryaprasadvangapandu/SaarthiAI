“Build a project called SaarthiAI: Multilingual Community Voice Assistant.
Use Python + FastAPI backend and simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend.
Create the entire folder structure and all files.

Core Requirements:

Voice Input (Browser Mic) → Send audio → Server → Convert audio to text.

Use the SpeechRecognition Python library or whisper small model for transcription.

Language: support Hindi, Telugu, English.

Intent Detection + Guidance System

Create a simple rule-based engine:

If query contains “fever”, “temperature”: give first-aid health advice.

If contains “scheme / yojana / application”: give welfare scheme info.

If contains “heatwave / flood / warning”: give climate safety guidance.

Responses must be simple, step-by-step instructions.

Text → Voice Reply

Use gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) or pyttsx3.

Return audio file back to frontend for playback.

API Endpoints

/transcribe → accepts audio, returns text

/respond → accepts text, returns AI guidance + voice audio

/health, /schemes, /climate (optional)

Frontend Requirements

A clean web page with:

Mic button (start/stop recording)

Chat bubbles for messages

Audio playback for responses

Language selector (Hindi, Telugu, English)

Offline Mode (basic)

Cache last 5 responses in localStorage.

If backend offline, show: “Offline mode active. Last known guidance:” and show cached responses.

Project Structure

main.py (FastAPI)

static/ (JS, CSS)

templates/index.html

models/logic.py → rule-based engine

utils/audio_helper.py → speech-to-text + text-to-speech

README.md with setup instructions

Demo Flow

User selects language → presses mic → speaks: “My child has fever.”

Frontend sends audio → /transcribe → text

/respond checks rule-engine → generates advice

Backend returns advice text + TTS audio

Frontend displays chat + plays audio

Extra Notes

Make sure CORS is enabled.

Make the UI responsive and simple.

Add comments in all code so I can understand.

App must run fully on Replit without external paid APIs.

Now generate the complete working code.”**
